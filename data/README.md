# Data Analysis
The idea was one can use the (pearson) correlation coefficient on user rating
and the MyAnimeList (MAL)'s average rating to determine
how much ones opinion deviate or allign with the averaged consensus.

## Methodology:

I ran the code on myself and my friends that have MyAnimeList (MAL)
and sampled other "random" MAL users.

### Sampling
A quick sampling method was devised to determine whether
my friends had peculiar correlation coefficient amongst MAL users.

I select the first three users starting from the 4200th position to have
added a given show to their list that have both rated the given show
and has at least 42 shows rated.

The 4200th position translates added to in the past week or two
which ensures a recently active user
but more importantly, likely to not be in the process of making their list.

The shows I picked to do this on were choosing the following shows on June 7th:

Ranked 42nd on MAL (r42):
https://myanimelist.net/anime/48583/Shingeki_no_Kyojin__The_Final_Season_Part_2

42nd most popular show on MAL (p42):
https://myanimelist.net/anime/22535/Kiseijuu__Sei_no_Kakuritsu

42nd most favourited show on MAL (f42):
https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail

42nd most rated movie on MAL (m42):
https://myanimelist.net/anime/40787/Josee_to_Tora_to_Sakana-tachi

## Analysis Findings
My friends and I fall within a moderate range of correlation coefficients
amongst the sampled users.

Amongst my MAL-using friends,
Jacob is on the higher end of correlation coefficient
while I am at the lower end.

When interpreting the relative ranking of correlation coefficients as an
indication of the extent to which a user's ratings deviate  from the consensus,
it can be concluded that I have the hottest takes among my friends.
